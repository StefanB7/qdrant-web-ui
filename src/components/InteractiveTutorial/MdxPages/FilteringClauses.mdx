Qdrant support filtering of collections combining condition and clauses.
In this tutorial you will learn how to filter collections using **filtering clauses**.

Clauses are different logical operations, such as OR, AND, and NOT.
Clauses can be recursively nested into each other so that you can reproduce an arbitrary boolean expression.

Let's start with creating a new collection and populating it with points.

## Set up for this tutorial

Before we start to practice with filtering conditions, let's create some datapoints to work with.

  <summary>Run these two steps:</summary>

1. Create a collection:

``` json withRunButton="true"
PUT collections/demo
{
  "vectors": {
  "size": 4,
  "distance": "Dot"
  }
}
```

2. And add points to it:

``` json withRunButton="true"
PUT /collections/demo/points
{
  "points": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "vector": [0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4],
      "payload": { "city": "London", "color": "green" }
    }, {
      "id": 2,
      "vector": [0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5],
      "payload": { "city": "London", "color": "red" }
    }, {
      "id": 3,
      "vector": [0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6],
      "payload": { "city": "London", "color": "blue" }
    }, {
      "id": 4,
      "vector": [0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.7],
      "payload": { "city": "Berlin", "color": "red" }
    }, {
      "id": 5,
      "vector": [0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8],
      "payload": { "city": "Moscow", "color": "green" }
    }, {
      "id": 6,
      "vector": [0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9],
      "payload": { "city": "Moscow", "color": "blue" }
    }
  ]
}
```
</details>

Take a note of what data we put into points' `payload` field.

## Must

When using `must`, the clause becomes `true` only if every condition listed inside `must` is satisfied.
In this sense, `must` is equivalent to the operator `AND`.

Run the next example:

``` json withRunButton="true"
POST /collections/demo/points/scroll
{
  "filter": {
    "must": [
      {
        "key": "city",
        "match": { "value": "London" }
      }, {
        "key": "color",
        "match": { "value": "red" }
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

## Should

When using `should`, the clause becomes `true` if at least one condition listed inside `should` is satisfied.
In this sense, `should` is equivalent to the operator `OR`.

Example:

``` json withRunButton="true"
POST /collections/demo/points/scroll
{
  "filter": {
    "should": [
      {
        "key": "city",
        "match": { "value": "London" }
      }, {
        "key": "color",
        "match": { "value": "red" }
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

## Must Not

When using `must_not`, the clause becomes `true` if none if the conditions listed inside `should` is satisfied.
In this sense, `must_not` is equivalent to the expression `(NOT A) AND (NOT B) AND (NOT C)`.

Example:

``` json withRunButton="true"
POST /collections/demo/points/scroll
{
  "filter": {
    "must_not": [
      {
        "key": "city",
        "match": { "value": "London" }
      }, {
        "key": "color",
        "match": { "value": "red" }
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

## Clauses combination

It is also possible to use several clauses simultaneously:

``` json withRunButton="true"
POST /collections/demo/points/scroll
{
  "filter": {
    "must": [
      {
        "key": "city",
        "match": { "value": "London" }
      }
    ],
    "must_not": [
      {
        "key": "color",
        "match": { "value": "red" }
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

In this case, the conditions are combined by `AND`.

Also, the conditions could be recursively nested. Example:

``` json withRunButton="true"
POST /collections/demo/points/scroll
{
  "filter": {
    "must_not": [
      {
        "must": [
          {
            "key": "city",
            "match": { "value": "London" }
          }, {
            "key": "color",
            "match": { "value": "red" }
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```
