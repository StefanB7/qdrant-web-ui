# Interactive Tutorial

## What is Qdrant?

Qdrant “is a vector similarity search engine that provides a production-ready service with a convenient API to store, search, and manage points (i.e. vectors) with an additional payload.”
You can think of the payloads as additional pieces of information that can help you hone in on your search and also receive useful information that you can give to your users.

You can get started using Qdrant with the Python qdrant-client, by pulling the latest docker image of qdrant and connecting to it locally, or by trying out Qdrant’s Cloud free tier option until you are ready to make the full switch.

## What is a interactive tutorial?

In this tutorial, we will guide you through using Qdrant to search for vectors similar to a given vector.
You will be able to run the code blocks in this tutorial and see the results in real-time.
You also can edit the code blocks and see how the results change.
